# Puppet Manifests

This is the sibling project to
[Nest](https://github.com/iamjamestl/puppet-nest), my personal Linux
distribution.  The main point of interest is probably the Hiera data, which is
structured according to the hierarchy defined in
[hiera.yaml](https://github.com/iamjamestl/puppet-nest/blob/master/files/puppet/hiera.yaml).

  # Prefer giving the kernel more of the virtual address space for ZFS
  CONFIG_VMSPLIT_2G: y
  CONFIG_VMSPLIT_3G: n

# Let ZFS access more of the kernel virtual address space made available by the
# VMSPLIT above.  With a 2G split, this setting basically only does anything on
# systems with more than 2G of memory, and it guarantees around 1G of "lowmem"
# space, which is more than any 3G/1G split can provide.  All of this extra
# flexibility comes at the cost of not being able to allocate more than 2G for
# a user process, a compromise I am willing to make.
